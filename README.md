# Nova Tools

A set of tools to modify the files in Nova, so we can get a translation going!

##AIF Parser (parser_aif.py) [Developed by Nagato]
This tool extracts AIF files (Specifically Phantasy Star: Nova files). This handles .aifs with multiple images inside, and also different image compressions.

##AIF to GXT (aif_to_gxt.py) [Developed by Nagato]
Converts AIF files to GXT files, for use with GXTConvert.

##GXT Convert (GXTConvert.exe) [Developed by xdaniel - https://twitter.com/xdanieldzd]
This converts GXT files to PNG.

##RMD Parser (parse_script.py)  [Developed by Nagato]
This tool outputs a HTML file and PNG file, which are used to view the scripts. It's not possible to output raw text without making a mapping between the various font files.

##Font Size Fix Tool (labyrinth_no_kanata_fix_font_size.py) [Developed by Nagato]
[Documentation needed]

##Script Insertion Tool (labyrinth_no_kanata_insert_script.py) [Developed by Nagato]
